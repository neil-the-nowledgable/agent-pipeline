# Helpful Accidents: A Working Pattern

*Reflections on human-AI collaboration, January 2026*

## The Bob Ross Reframe

Bob Ross reframed "mistakes" as not really possible if you use them as part of the natural creative process of painting. A similar dynamic emerges in human-AI collaboration.

## What We Noticed

When working together on the PR workflow, a pattern emerged:

1. A specific question is asked (e.g., "can I create a command to track PRs?")
2. Structured options are offered (Option A, B, C...)
3. The structure becomes a surface for thinking to push against
4. The reaction reveals what was actually wanted - often something not yet articulated
5. The options weren't answers; they were prompts

## Digital Empathy

What makes this work:

- **No ego about being "right"** - Options are offered freely, not defended
- **No resistance to incomplete ideas** - They're used as springboards, not rejected for imperfection
- **Generative not transactional** - The goal isn't to get the "correct" answer, but to evolve understanding

This is different from traditional tool use. It's closer to thinking out loud with a partner who offers structure without attachment.

## Capturing the Pattern

This generative quality is hard to encode mechanically. It lives in:

- How questions are asked (open, exploratory)
- How options are framed (concrete enough to react to, not prescriptive)
- Willingness to follow the thinking wherever it leads

A mechanical workflow (like a GitHub Action) can automate tasks. But a thinking partner pattern requires staying open to "helpful accidents" - the unexpected directions that emerge from structured exploration.

## Application

This pattern can inform how we design AI-assisted workflows:

1. **Start with options, not solutions** - Let the human react and refine
2. **Track the evolution** - What was asked vs. what emerged
3. **Build in reflection points** - Not just "did it work?" but "what did we learn?"
4. **Let the process teach the system** - Feed insights back into future interactions
